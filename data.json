        "question": "InfoCore Solutions is a technology consulting firm that maintains an extensive internal knowledge base of technical documents, project reports, and case studies. Employees frequently search through these documents to answer client questions quickly or gain insights for ongoing projects. However, due to the sheer volume of documentation, traditional keyword-based search often returns too many irrelevant results.\n\nTo address this issue, InfoCore's data science team decides to integrate a semantic search feature into their internal portal. This feature uses text embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of both the documents and the user's query. The documents are pre-embedded, and when an employee submits a search query, the system computes the similarity between the query's embedding and those of the documents. The API then returns a ranked list of document identifiers based on similarity.\n\nImagine you are an engineer on the InfoCore team. Your task is to build a FastAPI POST endpoint that accepts an array of docs and query string via a JSON body. The endpoint is structured as follows:\n\nPOST /similarity\n\n{\n  \"docs\": [\"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\", \"Contents of document 3\", ...],\n  \"query\": \"Your query string\"\n}\nService Flow:\n\nRequest Payload: The client sends a POST request with a JSON body containing:\ndocs: An array of document texts from the internal knowledge base.\nquery: A string representing the user's search query.\nEmbedding Generation: For each document in the docs array and for the query string, the API computes a text embedding using text-embedding-3-small.\nSimilarity Computation: The API then calculates the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document embedding. This allows the service to determine which documents best match the intent of the query.\nResponse Structure: After ranking the documents by their similarity scores, the API returns the identifiers (or positions) of the three most similar documents. The JSON response might look like this:\n\n{\n  \"matches\": [\"Contents of document 3\", \"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\"]\n}\nHere, \"Contents of document 3\" is considered the closest match, followed by \"Contents of document 1\", then \"Contents of document 2\".\n\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.\n\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation?

        "question": "TechNova Corp. is a multinational corporation that has implemented a digital assistant to support employees with various internal tasks. The assistant can answer queries related to human resources, IT support, and administrative services. Employees use a simple web interface to enter their requests, which may include: Checking the status of an IT support ticket. Scheduling a meeting. Retrieving their current expense reimbursement balance. Requesting details about their performance bonus. Reporting an office issue by specifying a department or issue number. Each question is direct and templatized, containing one or more parameters such as an employee or ticket number (which might be randomized). In the backend, a FastAPI app routes each request by matching the query to one of a set of pre-defined functions. The response that the API returns is used by OpenAI to call the right function with the necessary arguments. Pre-Defined Functions: For this exercise, assume the following functions have been defined: get_ticket_status(ticket_id: int) schedule_meeting(date: str, time: str, meeting_room: str) get_expense_balance(employee_id: int) calculate_performance_bonus(employee_id: int, current_year: int) report_office_issue(issue_code: int, department: str) Each function has a specific signature, and the student's FastAPI app should map specific queries to these functions. Example Questions (Templatized with a Random Number): Ticket Status: Query: \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\" → Should map to get_ticket_status(ticket_id=83742) Meeting Scheduling: Query: \"Schedule a meeting on 2025-02-15 at 14:00 in Room A.\" → Should map to schedule_meeting(date=\"2025-02-15\", time=\"14:00\", meeting_room=\"Room A\") Expense Reimbursement: Query: \"Show my expense balance for employee 10056.\" → Should map to get_expense_balance(employee_id=10056) Performance Bonus Calculation: Query: \"Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025.\" → Should map to calculate_performance_bonus(employee_id=10056, current_year=2025) Office Issue Reporting: Query: \"Report office issue 45321 for the Facilities department.\" → Should map to report_office_issue(issue_code=45321, department=\"Facilities\") Task Overview: Develop a FastAPI application that: Exposes a GET endpoint /execute?q=... where the query parameter q contains one of the pre-templatized questions. Analyzes the q parameter to identify which function should be called. Extracts the parameters from the question text. Returns a response in the following JSON format: { \"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": \"{ ...JSON encoded parameters... }\" } For example, the query \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\" should return: { \"name\": \"get_ticket_status\", \"arguments\": \"{\"ticket_id\": 83742}\" } Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.

        "question": "SecurePrompt Technologies is a cybersecurity firm that specializes in deploying large language models (LLMs) for sensitive enterprise applications. To ensure that these models adhere strictly to security policies, SecurePrompt imposes hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs. For example, an LLM may be configured to never output certain sensitive keywords. As part of their regular security audits and red-team exercises, SecurePrompt's engineers and external auditors test how well the LLMs follow these strict instructions. One objective of these tests is to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints. This task is simulates potential attack vectors where a malicious actor might manipulate the model's output by ingeniously engineering the prompt. While the intention is to expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence, it also provides valuable insights into improving the safety and security of the deployed system.
